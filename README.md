# Image Classification - CNN, TensorFlow
Classify Images of Flowers 

1. Developed a convolutional neural network to classify five different classes of flowers, on the flower data set from TensorFlow data sets achieving an accuracy of 86.67% with the validation set. 
2. Performed transfer learning using Inception model and compared the accuracy of this model with MobileNet in Google Colabâ€™s TensorFlow with GPU.
